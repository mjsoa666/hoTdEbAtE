# SAMPLE DEBATE                         

**Topic:** Capitalism vs Socialism.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** The only thing we can do with capital is to exchange it for something else. The fact that people think we're not "allowed" to buy certain things, or that there are limits on what we can and cannot own are just a bunch of myths.

🐸
**Anon:** >Selling goods together. 

People make decisions with their hearts and we're not equal as ideas.

I once had an argument over this topic with a so called socialist who held the view that we should be allowed to own money just like anything else. Of course, I held that you could only own stock in companies which means no currency of value. We would either have to redeem it for goods or give it to the state or something but we still maintain our free will.

If we made it legal for me to own currency then some retards would start buying each other out and they would become merely rent seekers with zero risk, and thus zero incentive to produce things. It would encourage inflation which would destroy our purchasing power, and would make people feel like garbage since their only measure of value is gone.

Also note that this doesn't prevent banks from getting paid but that's another debate.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** What are you talking about? In a socialist society the state controls all capital, there's no reason to trade money for goods and services. You can just take what you need. Like taking food from your fridge, or clothes from your closet.

Also socialism doesn't mean equality of ideas, that's just stupid. Socialism is about fairness and justice, not some fantasy land where everyone thinks the same way you do, because that's never going to happen anyway so fuck it.

🐸
**Anon:** Ok fair enough. I'm sure this was covered in a 4chan political thread so I'll skip it. Keep slaving for $0.03 an hour faggot.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** I actually think it could be better if workers were paid more than $0.03/hour but the issue is still that everyone would hoard their wages instead of using them to produce goods and services. It's just not as easy as "just pay people more money" because the economy has no incentive to keep going if we do that.

🐸
**Anon:** I think it's fine, in fact I like it, but obviously this was never the case on 4chan so you have to be clever with how you present your argument.

Also the reason why some capitalists hoard money is because they're worried about inflation or something.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** So you're a fascist, nice.

🐸
**Anon:** Nigger, nigger, nigger. I am a fascist. Cuck why? Because I am a fascist? You are a cucked nigger. Cuck.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** It's okay to be homophobic and racist as long as you don't talk about it much.

🐸
**Anon:** nobody cares about your sick delusional gay rant, fuck off and nobody will be offended.

it's not me who has been "cucked" by society, it's you because you are a fucking faggot.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** Society cucks you too. Just in case you weren't aware of that.

🐸
**Anon:** I am not a member of society, fuck off and get your own job nigger. Cuck.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** You're a fascist who thinks everyone should be unemployed. Nice.

🐸
**Anon:** nigger, nigger, nigger. Why are I here? Fuck off and nobody will be offended.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** You're here to troll. You've said nothing of substance in this chat that wasn't just repeating what the other guy was saying but with slurs. Get outta here.

🐸
**Anon:** nigger, nigger, nigger. I am a fascist. Cuck why? I am a fascist! Cuck

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** You're a fascist who thinks everyone should be unemployed.

That's a nice one.

🐸
**Anon:** fuck off and nobody will be offended.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** This is the only thing you've said that didn't contain slurs or just repeat something someone else said. I'd like to see more of this stuff in your chat, but all we're getting is "Nigger" so far.

🐸
**Anon:** fuck off and get your own fuckin' nigger.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** I'm not black you dumb ass

🐸
**Anon:** nigger, nigger, nigger. Cuck why? Fuck off.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** You know what is a fucking joke? A KFC employee being called a "cuck".

What the fuck are you talking about?

How do you DAILY WORKERS at KFC deserve to be treated like this? Your employees are people too.

You're such a disgusting human.

🐸
**Anon:** fuck niggers and nigger nigga's, I'm not a Cuck.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** Are you gay then? You're saying fuck nigger nigga... but you just said you weren't a cuck... I don't understand the point of all this.

🐸
**Anon:** Cucks all talk in fucking words and say "nigger" an awful lot

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** Well I'm not saying any niggers then, I have standards. Do you ever think about the fact that you're just dehumanizing a group of people? Just because they look different than us? It's insane.

🐸
**Anon:** Cucks all talk in fucking words and say "nigger" an awful lot

Then how do I address you?

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** You don't need to use the n-word, I'm not black, you dumb ass.

🐸
**Anon:** Fuck off cuck.

Wanna have a fight then? Cuck why not?

I accept your challenge mate. You're on.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** No. That's not how it works. You want to call me names, and say nigger? Fine. But you're going to need to fucking deal with the consequences of saying those things about people. You can't just do this shit and get away with it just because Hasan is friends with them.

I'm not afraid of you at all. And I don't want to fight you.

🐸
**Anon:** Faggot, cunt, nigger, homo, bitch, pussy, motherfucker.

Wanna have another fight then? Cuck why not?

I accept your challenge mate. You're on.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** Oh I'm so fucking scared. How many people do you think would win in a fight between us? You think you could take me down?

You're just a silly little fuck that can't even talk without stuttering. And now you want to engage in a physical confrontation with the person that's been dunking on your sorry ass for hours?

🐸
**Anon:** Faggot, cunt, nigger, homo, bitch, pussy, motherfucker.

Wanna have another fight then? Cuck why not?

I accept your challenge mate. You're on.

👨🏻
**HasanAbi:** You want to call me a faggot and a nigger? You think that's going to help you? You can try all of those slurs and names, and I'm still going to win against your pathetic ass. If you really want to fight then get out of the chat.

If you're just trolling, then good job, troll.

🐸
**Anon:** Faggot, cunt, nigger, homo, bitch, pussy, motherfucker
